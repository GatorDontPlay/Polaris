# 🎯 **CEO PDR Status Filtering Guide**

## **📊 CEO Dashboard - Overview Tab**

### **Pending Reviews Count:**
Shows PDRs that need CEO attention:
```typescript
pendingReviews: realPDRs.filter(pdr => 
  pdr.status === 'SUBMITTED' ||           // Employee submitted for review
  pdr.status === 'OPEN_FOR_REVIEW' ||     // Opened for CEO review  
  pdr.status === 'UNDER_REVIEW'           // Currently being reviewed
).length
```

### **Completed PDRs Count:**
Shows finished PDRs:
```typescript
completedPDRs: realPDRs.filter(pdr => 
  pdr.status === 'COMPLETED'              // PDR process completed
).length
```

### **Recent Activity:**
Shows all PDRs (regardless of status) as activity entries

### **Pending Reviews List:**
Shows PDRs that appear in the pending section:
```typescript
pendingReviews: realPDRs.filter(pdr => 
  pdr.status === 'SUBMITTED' ||           // Employee submitted
  pdr.status === 'OPEN_FOR_REVIEW' ||     // Ready for review
  pdr.status === 'UNDER_REVIEW' ||        // Being reviewed
  pdr.status === 'Created'                // Also shows newly created
)
```

## **📋 CEO Reviews Page - Status Mapping**

### **Employee PDR Status → CEO Review Status:**
```typescript
'Created' → 'pending_review'       // New PDRs awaiting submission
'DRAFT' → 'pending_review'         // Draft PDRs (shouldn't normally show)
'SUBMITTED' → 'pending_review'     // Submitted and awaiting CEO review
'UNDER_REVIEW' → 'under_review'    // CEO is currently reviewing
'COMPLETED' → 'completed'          // Review process finished
```

### **Reviews Page Tab Filtering:**

#### **🟡 Pending Tab:**
```typescript
reviews.filter(review => review.status === 'pending_review')
```
**Shows:**
- PDRs with status `'Created'` 
- PDRs with status `'SUBMITTED'` ← **Your PDR will be here**
- Any other draft statuses

#### **🔵 Under Review Tab:**
```typescript
reviews.filter(review => review.status === 'under_review')  
```
**Shows:**
- PDRs with status `'UNDER_REVIEW'`

#### **🟢 Completed Tab:**
```typescript
reviews.filter(review => review.status === 'completed')
```
**Shows:**
- PDRs with status `'COMPLETED'`

#### **📊 All Reviews Tab:**
Shows all PDRs regardless of status

## **🎯 Your Current PDR Status: `'SUBMITTED'`**

### **Where Your PDR Appears in CEO View:**

#### **✅ CEO Dashboard:**
- ✅ **Pending Reviews Count**: +1 (included in count)
- ✅ **Recent Activity**: "Employee Demo submitted their PDR for review"
- ✅ **Pending Reviews List**: Listed as "Employee Demo" from Demo Department

#### **✅ CEO Reviews Page:**
- ✅ **Pending Tab**: Your PDR shows here (status mapped to `'pending_review'`)
- ❌ **Under Review Tab**: Empty (PDR not in `'UNDER_REVIEW'` status yet)
- ❌ **Completed Tab**: Empty (PDR not `'COMPLETED'` yet)
- ✅ **All Reviews Tab**: Shows your PDR + demo PDRs

### **Completion Rate Display:**
Your PDR shows `95%` completion because:
```typescript
completionRate: pdr.status === 'SUBMITTED' ? 95 : // ← Your PDR gets 95%
                pdr.currentStep ? (pdr.currentStep / 5) * 100 : 20
```

## **🔄 Status Progression for CEO:**

### **1. Employee Submits (`'SUBMITTED'`):**
- **CEO sees**: Pending Reviews count increases
- **Reviews page**: PDR appears in "Pending" tab
- **Next action**: CEO clicks to review → status becomes `'UNDER_REVIEW'`

### **2. CEO Reviews (`'UNDER_REVIEW'`):**
- **CEO sees**: PDR moves to "Under Review" tab
- **Reviews page**: PDR no longer in "Pending", now in "Under Review"
- **Next action**: CEO completes review → status becomes `'COMPLETED'`

### **3. Review Complete (`'COMPLETED'`):**
- **CEO sees**: PDR moves to "Completed" tab
- **Dashboard**: Completed count increases, Pending count decreases

## **🧪 Test CEO Filtering:**

### **With Your Current SUBMITTED PDR:**
1. **Go to CEO role** → **Dashboard** 
2. **Should see**: Pending Reviews = 1 (or more)
3. **Should see**: "Employee Demo submitted their PDR" in recent activity
4. **Go to Reviews page** → **Pending tab**
5. **Should see**: Your PDR listed as "Employee Demo"

### **Status Progression Test:**
Currently the CEO view doesn't have buttons to change PDR status, but the filtering logic is:
- **`'SUBMITTED'`** → Shows in "Pending" tab ← **Your PDR is here**
- **`'UNDER_REVIEW'`** → Would show in "Under Review" tab  
- **`'COMPLETED'`** → Would show in "Completed" tab

**Your PDR with status `'SUBMITTED'` should appear in the CEO's "Pending" tab, ready for review!** 🎯
