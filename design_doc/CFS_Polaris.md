## 1. Project Overview
### 1.1 Project Name
Polaris - Performance & Development Review (PDR) System

### 1.2 Project Description
Polaris is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline employee performance reviews and development planning. The system provides a structured framework for setting goals, assessing behaviors aligned with company values, conducting mid-year and end-year reviews, and maintaining a complete audit trail of the performance management process.

### 1.3 Objective
The Polaris PDR System aims to modernize and simplify the performance review process by:

- Providing employees with a self-service platform to manage their performance goals and assessments
- Enabling CEOs and administrators with powerful tools to oversee, review, and rate employee performance
- Creating transparency and structure in the performance management process
- Maintaining comprehensive records for compliance and historical reference
- Streamlining what is typically a paper-heavy, inefficient process into a digital workflow
