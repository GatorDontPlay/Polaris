# CEO Final Review Persistence Fix - Complete

## Issue Summary
CEO's final review scores and comments for goals and behaviors were not persisting after clicking "Complete Final Review" and refreshing the page.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Duplicate Behavior Review Keys (FIXED)**
**Problem**: The `finalBehaviorReviews` React state was being populated with duplicate entries using inconsistent keys:
- On page load: Used fallback logic `behavior.value?.id || behavior.valueId || behavior.id`
- During user interaction: Used `valueData.companyValue.id` (company value UUID)
- **Result**: 8 entries instead of 4 (behavior row IDs + value_ids)

**Solution**: Changed both locations to consistently use `valueId` / `value_id`:
- **Line 1435** in `page.tsx`: `const behaviorKey = behavior.valueId;`
- **Line 1077** in `page.tsx`: `const behaviorId = behavior.value_id || behavior.valueId;`

### 2. **RLS Policy Blocking CEO Updates (FIXED)**
**Problem**: The `complete-final-review` API endpoint was using the regular Supabase client, which enforces Row Level Security (RLS) policies. The CEO user didn't have `UPDATE` permissions on the `behaviors` and `goals` tables, resulting in "Updated 0 behavior(s)" in logs.

**Solution**: Switched to Supabase service role client (`supabaseAdmin`) for all database update operations:
```typescript
const supabaseAdmin = createServiceClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);
```

### 3. **Incorrect API Matching (FIXED)**
**Problem**: Frontend was sending behavior reviews keyed by `value_id` (company value UUID), but the API was initially trying to match by `id` (behavior row UUID).

**Solution**: Updated API to match by `value_id`:
```typescript
const { error: behaviorUpdateError } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('behaviors')
  .update({ /* ... */ })
  .eq('value_id', valueId)  // Match by company value UUID
  .eq('pdr_id', pdrId);
```

### 4. **Missing State Refresh After Save (FIXED)**
**Problem**: After completing the final review, the local React state was not being refreshed with the saved data.

**Solution**: Added explicit state updates in `handleCompleteFinalReview`:
- Updated `pdr` state with new status
- Updated `endYearReviewData` state
- Updated `goals` and `behaviors` states
- Updated `finalGoalReviews` and `finalBehaviorReviews` states

### 5. **Missing Data Load on Page Load (FIXED)**
**Problem**: When the user navigated to the Final Review tab after a page refresh, the `finalGoalReviews` and `finalBehaviorReviews` states were not being populated from the database.

**Solution**: Added code in the Final Review tab's `useEffect` to populate these states from the fetched data:
```typescript
// Populate finalBehaviorReviews state from database data  
const behaviorsWithCeoReviews: Record<string, { rating: number; comments: string }> = {};
refreshedBehaviors.forEach((behavior: any) => {
  const behaviorKey = behavior.valueId;
  if (behavior.ceoRating || behavior.ceoComments) {
    behaviorsWithCeoReviews[behaviorKey] = {
      rating: behavior.ceoRating || 0,
      comments: behavior.ceoComments || '',
    };
  }
});
setFinalBehaviorReviews(behaviorsWithCeoReviews);
```

### 6. **Excessive Logging Causing localStorage Quota Error (FIXED)**
**Problem**: Diagnostic logging in the API was causing `Resource::kQuotaBytes quota exceeded` errors.

**Solution**: Removed excessive console.log statements from the API endpoint, keeping only essential error logging.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/app/(ceo)/admin/reviews/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Line 1435**: Changed behavior key to use `valueId` consistently
- **Line 1077**: Changed behavior ID to use `value_id` or `valueId` consistently
- **Lines 968-1098**: Added state refresh logic after final review completion
- **Lines 1431-1444**: Added initial state population from database on Final Review tab load

### 2. `src/app/api/pdrs/[id]/complete-final-review/route.ts`
- **Lines 10, 56-60**: Added Supabase service role client initialization
- **Lines 102-110**: Updated behavior updates to use `supabaseAdmin` and match by `value_id`
- **Lines 127-136**: Updated goal updates to use `supabaseAdmin`
- **Lines 151-159**: Updated end-year review updates to use `supabaseAdmin`
- **Lines 172-177**: Updated PDR status update to use `supabaseAdmin`
- **Removed**: Excessive diagnostic logging

## Testing Results

✅ **Behaviors**: All 4 behaviors successfully updated in database  
✅ **Goals**: All goals successfully updated in database  
✅ **Persistence**: Data persists after page refresh  
✅ **localStorage Quota**: Error resolved by removing excessive logging  
✅ **State Updates**: UI reflects saved data immediately after submission  

## Key Takeaways

1. **Consistent Key Usage**: Always use the same key structure (`value_id`) throughout the data flow
2. **Service Role for Admin Operations**: Use Supabase service role client for CEO/admin operations that need to bypass RLS
3. **State Synchronization**: Refresh all related React states after database updates
4. **Initial State Population**: Load data from database when component mounts or tab activates
5. **Logging Hygiene**: Remove diagnostic logging after debugging to avoid storage quota issues

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All CEO final review data now persists correctly to the database and displays after page refresh.
