# Demo Audit System Test Guide

## What's Been Implemented

✅ **Real Audit Logging System**: No synthetic data - tracks actual user actions
✅ **localStorage Audit Storage**: Stores audit logs alongside PDR data
✅ **Comprehensive Action Tracking**: Logs all PDR, Goals, and Behaviors operations
✅ **Real-time Activity Updates**: Recent Activity updates immediately when actions occur
✅ **Demo-Compatible**: Works seamlessly with existing localStorage demo system

## How to Test

### 1. Clear Existing Data (Optional)
```javascript
// In browser console
clearDemoAuditLogs(); // Clear audit logs
// Or clear all demo data via dashboard
```

### 2. Perform User Actions
As an employee user, perform these actions:

1. **Create a PDR** → Should log "created new PDR"
2. **Add goals** → Should log "added a new goal" for each goal
3. **Update goals** → Should log "updated a goal" 
4. **Add behaviors** → Should log "added behavior assessment"
5. **Update behaviors** → Should log "updated behavior assessment"
6. **Submit PDR** → Should log "submitted PDR for review"

### 3. Check Recent Activity
- Navigate to employee dashboard
- **Recent Activity** section should now show real actions
- Each action should have proper timestamp and message

### 4. Debug if Needed
```javascript
// In browser console
debugDemoAuditLogs(); // View all audit logs and recent activity
```

## Expected Results

### ✅ Before (Issue)
- Recent Activity: "No recent activity"
- No tracking of user actions

### ✅ After (Fixed)
- Recent Activity: Shows real user actions like:
  - "You created new PDR" (2 minutes ago)
  - "You added a new goal" (1 minute ago) 
  - "You added behavior assessment" (30 seconds ago)
  - "You submitted PDR for review" (Just now)

## Technical Details

### Audit Log Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string;           // Unique log ID
  userId: string;       // Demo user ID
  action: 'INSERT' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE';
  tableName: 'pdrs' | 'goals' | 'behaviors';
  recordId: string;     // ID of affected record
  oldValues?: any;      // Previous state (for updates)
  newValues?: any;      // New state
  changedAt: Date;      // When action occurred
}
```

### Activity Conversion
Audit logs are converted to user-friendly activity messages:
- `pdrs` + `INSERT` → "created new PDR"
- `pdrs` + `UPDATE` (status=SUBMITTED) → "submitted PDR for review"
- `goals` + `INSERT` → "added a new goal"
- `behaviors` + `INSERT` → "added behavior assessment"

### Storage Location
- Audit logs: `localStorage['demo_audit_logs']`
- Keeps last 100 logs automatically
- Real-time updates via events

## Verification Commands

```javascript
// Check if audit logging is working
localStorage.getItem('demo_audit_logs');

// View processed activities
debugDemoAuditLogs();

// Clear for fresh test
clearDemoAuditLogs();
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Recent Activity shows real user actions instead of "No recent activity"  
✅ Actions appear immediately after being performed  
✅ Messages are user-friendly ("You added a new goal")  
✅ Timestamps are accurate  
✅ No synthetic/fake data  
✅ Works across browser refreshes
