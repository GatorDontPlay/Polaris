# PDR System - Core Development Rules

## PROJECT ESSENCE
You're building an Employee Performance & Development Review (PDR) System with employee stepper UI and CEO admin flows. Reference uploaded stage files for detailed requirements.

## TECH STACK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript (strict mode)
- shadcn/ui components exclusively (MCP setup available)
- PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- JWT authentication with role-based access
- RESTful API architecture
- ESLint + Prettier (auto-format on save)
- Australian date format (DD/MM/YYYY) everywhere

## CORE PRINCIPLES
1. Two user roles: EMPLOYEE (own data only) and CEO (all data)
2. Status-driven permissions (CEO can always edit/unlock)
3. Audit trail for all data changes
4. Mobile-first responsive design
5. Type-safe code with comprehensive error handling
6. Reusable components where logical

## DATA FLOW
Employee: Dashboard → Stepper (Goals → Behaviours → Review → Submit) → Mid-Year → End-Year
CEO: Dashboard → Employee List → Review/Edit → Lock/Unlock → Scoring

Always reference stage files for detailed requirements. Ask which specific area you need help with.
