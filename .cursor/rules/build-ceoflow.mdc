## Build the CEO/Admin flow

- Create CEO Dashboard:

- For each employee:
  - Review/refine "What" and "How"
  - Add comments, ratings, lock/unlock plan
  - Mid-year feedback, end-of-year scoring
  - Lock in final scores and new plan

- Integrate with backend for data persistence and validation.
- Enforce CEO permissions (can always edit/unlock).
