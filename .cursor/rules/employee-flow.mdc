## Build the Employee flow with a stepper UI

- Create Employee Dashboard:
  - Show current PDR status, link to active PDR, history table

- Implement Stepper UI:
  - Step 1: Propose "What" (add/edit/remove goals)
  - Step 2: Propose "How" (add behaviours for each value)
  - Step 3: Review & Submit
  - Step 4: Mid-Year Check-In (progress, blockers, comments)
  - Step 5: End-of-Year Review (self-assessment, summary)

- Integrate with backend for data persistence and validation.
- Add a progress bar/stepper indicator.
- Enforce permissions (edit only if not locked).
