# Recent Activity Implementation Summary

## Overview
Replaced hardcoded placeholder data in the Recent Activity component with legitimate user-specific PDR activity data sourced from the audit logs database.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Endpoint (`/src/app/api/activity/route.ts`)
- Created new API endpoint `/api/activity` to fetch user-specific recent activity
- Queries audit logs filtered by the authenticated user's ID
- Processes audit log entries into meaningful activity messages
- Supports configurable limit parameter (default: 10 items)
- Activity types tracked:
  - PDR status changes (submitted, completed, started reviews)
  - Goal additions and updates (including self-ratings)
  - Behavior assessments (including self-ratings)
  - Mid-year and end-year review submissions

### 2. React Hook (`/src/hooks/use-activity.ts`)
- Created `useUserActivity` hook for fetching user activity data
- Uses React Query with caching and automatic refetching
- Stale time: 2 minutes
- Refetch interval: 5 minutes

### 3. Updated Recent Activity Component (`/src/components/admin/recent-activity.tsx`)
- Added `isUserActivity` prop to handle user-specific vs admin views
- Updated ActivityItem import to use correct type definition
- Conditional rendering:
  - User activity: Shows "You [action]" format
  - Admin activity: Shows "[User Name] [action]" format
  - Hides user details for personal activity view

### 4. Updated Types (`/src/types/index.ts`)
- Enhanced ActivityItem interface to include:
  - Additional activity types: `goal_added`, `behavior_assessed`
  - User email field
  - Priority field: `'low' | 'medium' | 'high'`

### 5. Employee Dashboard Update (`/src/app/(employee)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Replaced hardcoded Recent Activity section with dynamic component
- Uses `useUserActivity` hook to fetch real data
- Passes `isUserActivity={true}` for proper formatting

## Data Sources
The activity data is sourced from existing audit logs that are already being created throughout the application:
- Login/logout actions
- PDR status changes
- Goal creation and updates
- Behavior assessment creation and updates
- Mid-year and end-year review submissions

## User Experience
- **No Activity**: Shows appropriate empty state message
- **Loading State**: Displays skeleton loaders while fetching data
- **Real-time Updates**: Activity automatically refreshes every 5 minutes
- **Personal Context**: Activity messages are formatted in first person ("You submitted...")
- **Priority Indicators**: Important activities show priority badges

## Technical Benefits
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
- **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexing on audit logs
- **Scalability**: Configurable limits and pagination-ready structure
- **Caching**: React Query provides efficient data management
- **Real-time**: Automatic background updates with stale-while-revalidate pattern

## Future Enhancements
- Add activity filtering by type or date range
- Implement real-time updates via WebSocket for immediate activity reflection
- Add pagination for users with extensive activity history
- Include additional context like which PDR or goal was affected
