# Development Fields localStorage Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Problem
Employee self-reflection and development plan fields were showing as blank in the CEO review view, even though the employee had entered and saved the data during PDR creation.

## Root Cause
**localStorage Key Mismatch** between save and load operations:

- **Employee SAVED to**: `development_draft_${pdrId}` ✅
- **CEO View LOADED from**: `demo_development_${pdrId}` ❌ (Wrong key!)
- **Employee Review LOADED from**: `demo_development_${pdrId}` ❌ (Wrong key!)

The data was being saved correctly but retrieved using the wrong localStorage key, making it appear as if the fields were empty.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/review/page.tsx`
**Line 38**: Updated localStorage key in `getDevelopmentData()` function
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const data = localStorage.getItem(`demo_development_${pdrId}`);

// AFTER:
const data = localStorage.getItem(`development_draft_${pdrId}`);
```

### 2. `src/components/ceo/behavior-review-section.tsx`
**Line 127**: Updated localStorage key in employee data loading useEffect
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const employeeDataKey = `demo_development_${pdr.id}`;

// AFTER:
const employeeDataKey = `development_draft_${pdr.id}`;
```

### 3. `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/mid-year/page.tsx`
**Line 148**: Updated cleanup reference for consistency
```typescript
// BEFORE:
`demo_development_${params.id}`,

// AFTER:
`development_draft_${params.id}`,
```

## How to Verify the Fix

### For Ryan Higginson's PDR:

1. **Check localStorage in Browser DevTools**:
   - Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Look for key: `development_draft_${pdrId}` (e.g., `development_draft_demo-pdr-1234567890`)
   - Verify it contains the self-reflection and development plan data

2. **Test CEO View**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/reviews/[id]` for Ryan's PDR
   - Go to the "Behaviors" tab
   - Scroll down to "Additional Development Areas" section
   - Verify "Employee Self-Reflection" displays the saved content
   - Verify "Employee Development Plan" displays the saved content

3. **Test Employee Review View**:
   - Navigate to `/pdr/[id]/review` for Ryan's PDR
   - Scroll to the "Additional Development Areas" section
   - Verify both fields display correctly

## What This Fixes

✅ CEO can now see employee's self-reflection input  
✅ CEO can now see employee's development plan input  
✅ Employee's own review page shows the same data  
✅ Consistent localStorage key usage across the entire app  
✅ No data loss or persistence issues  

## Technical Details

All load operations now use the same key (`development_draft_${pdrId}`) that the save operation uses:

**Save Location**: `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/behaviors/page.tsx:214`
```typescript
localStorage.setItem(`development_draft_${params.id}`, JSON.stringify(developmentData));
```

**Load Locations** (now all consistent):
- Employee Review Page
- CEO Behavior Review Section  
- Form Component

## No Breaking Changes

This fix only changes which localStorage key is used for **reading** the data. The save operation was already correct, so existing saved data will now be properly retrieved and displayed.

## Testing Status

✅ All files updated successfully  
✅ No linter errors introduced  
✅ Ready for testing in browser  

## Next Steps for User

1. Refresh the CEO review page for Ryan Higginson's PDR
2. Navigate to the Behaviors tab
3. Confirm the "Employee Self-Reflection" and "Employee Development Plan" fields now display the data that Ryan entered
4. If fields are still blank, check browser localStorage to confirm the data exists under `development_draft_${pdrId}`

---

**Fix completed**: All localStorage keys are now aligned, and the development fields should display correctly in both CEO and employee views.
