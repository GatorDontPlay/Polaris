# 🔧 **Duplicate PDR Data Fix**

## **Problem Identified:**
You have **two versions** of the same PDR in localStorage:

1. **`demo_current_pdr`**: Status = `"Created"` (outdated, shows as "Draft")
2. **`demo_pdr_demo-pdr-1755225394194`**: Status = `"SUBMITTED"` (current, should be used)

The CEO dashboard was loading both and using the older one.

## **✅ Solution Applied:**

### **1. Enhanced Data Loading Logic:**
- Added detailed console logging to show which PDRs are found
- Implemented duplicate detection using PDR ID
- **Uses most recent version** based on `updatedAt` timestamp
- Prioritizes the submitted version over draft version

### **🧪 Testing the Fix:**

1. **Go to CEO Dashboard → Reviews tab**
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Look for new logs:**

```
🔍 getAllPDRsFromStorage: Scanning localStorage...
📄 Found demo_current_pdr: {id: "demo-pdr-1755225394194", status: "Created"}
📄 Found demo_pdr_demo-pdr-1755225394194: {id: "demo-pdr-1755225394194", status: "SUBMITTED"}
🔄 Using PDR demo-pdr-1755225394194 from demo_pdr_demo-pdr-1755225394194 (status: SUBMITTED)
⏭️  Skipping older PDR demo-pdr-1755225394194 from demo_current_pdr (status: Created)
✅ Final PDRs for CEO dashboard: [{id: "demo-pdr-1755225394194", status: "SUBMITTED"}]
```

4. **Expected Results:**
   - ✅ **Upcoming tab**: Should be empty (no "Draft" PDR)
   - ✅ **For Review tab**: Should show badge `For Review (1)` 
   - ✅ **Your PDR**: Should appear in "For Review" with status "SUBMITTED"

## **🧹 Manual Cleanup (If Needed):**

If you still see the duplicate, run this in browser console:

```javascript
// Remove the outdated current PDR
localStorage.removeItem('demo_current_pdr');

// Keep only the submitted version
console.log('Cleaned up duplicate PDR data');

// Refresh the page
window.location.reload();
```

## **Expected Final State:**

### **CEO Dashboard Tabs:**
- **Upcoming (0)**: Empty - no badge
- **For Review (1)**: Your SUBMITTED PDR - blue badge  ← **Should be here**
- **Locked (0)**: Empty - no badge  
- **Meetings Booked (0)**: Empty - no badge

### **PDR Workflow:**
1. ✅ Employee creates PDR (`Created`) → **Upcoming**
2. ✅ Employee submits PDR (`SUBMITTED`) → **For Review** ← **Current state**
3. 🔄 CEO reviews PDR (`UNDER_REVIEW`) → **For Review**  
4. 🔄 CEO locks PDR (`PLAN_LOCKED`) → **Locked**
5. 🔄 CEO books meeting (`PDR_BOOKED`) → **Meetings Booked**

**The system should now prioritize the submitted PDR and show it in the correct "For Review" tab!** 🎯
