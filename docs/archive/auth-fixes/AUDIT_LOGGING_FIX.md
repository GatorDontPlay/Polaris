# Audit Logging Fix - Recent Activity Issue

## üêõ Problem Identified
The console logs showed:
```
No demo user found for audit logging
```

This meant the audit system couldn't find the demo user data, so no audit logs were being created, resulting in "No recent activity".

## üîç Root Cause
**Mismatch in localStorage keys:**
- **Demo Auth System** stores user in: `localStorage['demo_user']`
- **Audit System** was looking for: `localStorage['demo_auth']`

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### Updated `src/lib/demo-audit.ts`
Changed the `getCurrentDemoUser()` function:

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
const authData = localStorage.getItem('demo_auth');
if (authData) {
  const { user } = JSON.parse(authData);
  return user;
}

// AFTER (correct)
const userData = localStorage.getItem('demo_user');
if (userData) {
  const user = JSON.parse(userData);
  return user;
}
```

### Added Better Debugging
- Enhanced error messages to show available localStorage keys
- Added `testDemoAudit()` function for easy testing

## üß™ How to Test the Fix

### 1. Test the System
```javascript
// In browser console
testDemoAudit(); // Should show "User found: true" and create test audit
```

### 2. Perform Real Actions
1. Create/update PDR, goals, or behaviors
2. Check Recent Activity - should now show real actions
3. Verify with: `debugDemoAuditLogs()`

### 3. Expected Results
**Console should now show:**
```
Demo audit log created: {
  action: 'INSERT',
  table: 'goals', 
  user: 'John Employee'
}
```

**Recent Activity should show:**
- "You added a new goal" (2 minutes ago)
- "You submitted PDR for review" (Just now)

## üéØ Success Criteria
‚úÖ No more "No demo user found" errors  
‚úÖ Audit logs are created for all actions  
‚úÖ Recent Activity shows real user actions  
‚úÖ Activity updates in real-time  

The fix ensures the audit system can properly find the demo user and track all actions for the Recent Activity feed.
