# Mid-Year Check-in Comments Fix - Complete ✅

## Problem

CEO's mid-year check-in comments for goals and behaviors were not saving reliably. Comments would disappear after typing, especially when switching tabs.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Race Condition Between Save and Load
- CEO types comment → debounced save starts (500ms delay)
- Before save completes, tab switch or data refresh triggers loading useEffect
- Loading useEffect overwrites local state with stale database data
- User's unsaved typing disappears

### 2. Overly Broad useEffect Dependencies
- Main loading useEffect depended on `[pdr, pdrId, goals, behaviors]`
- Any change to `goals` or `behaviors` (like employee rating updates) triggered full reload
- Reload overwrote mid-year comments even though goals/behaviors changes were unrelated

### 3. No Protection for In-Flight Saves
- No mechanism to prevent loading from overwriting data being saved
- No tracking of which comments were actively being edited

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: Add Save Completion Tracking

#### ✅ Added Tracking Refs
**File**: `src/app/(ceo)/admin/reviews/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 144-146)

```typescript
// Track if mid-year comments are actively being saved (to prevent overwriting during load)
const isSavingMidYearGoalComment = useRef<Record<string, boolean>>({});
const isSavingMidYearBehaviorComment = useRef<Record<string, boolean>>({});
```

These refs act as "locks" to prevent loading useEffects from overwriting comments that are currently being saved.

#### ✅ Updated Goal Check-in Save Function
**File**: `src/app/(ceo)/admin/reviews/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 368-425)

**Changes**:
1. Set lock flag when save starts: `isSavingMidYearGoalComment.current[goalId] = true`
2. Clear lock flag when save completes successfully
3. Clear lock flag on error (so user can retry)
4. Added detailed logging:
   - `🔒 Locking goal ${goalId}` - Save starting
   - `✅ Goal check-in comment saved successfully` - Save complete
   - `🔓 Unlocked goal ${goalId}` - Lock released

**Key Code**:
```typescript
const debouncedSaveGoalCheckIn = useCallback((goalId: string, comment: string) => {
  // ... clear existing timer ...
  
  // Mark this comment as being saved
  isSavingMidYearGoalComment.current[goalId] = true;
  console.log(`🔒 Locking goal ${goalId} comment from being overwritten during save`);
  
  midYearGoalCheckInTimer.current = setTimeout(async () => {
    try {
      // ... save to database ...
      
      if (response.ok) {
        isSavingMidYearGoalComment.current[goalId] = false; // Release lock
        console.log(`🔓 Unlocked goal ${goalId} comment after successful save`);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      isSavingMidYearGoalComment.current[goalId] = false; // Release lock on error
    }
  }, 500);
}, [pdr, pdrId]);
```

#### ✅ Updated Behavior Check-in Save Function
**File**: `src/app/(ceo)/admin/reviews/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 427-482)

Same pattern as goals:
- Lock on save start
- Unlock on save complete
- Unlock on error
- Comprehensive logging

### Phase 2: Protect Loading from Overwriting Saves

#### ✅ Updated Existing Loading Logic
**File**: `src/app/(ceo)/admin/reviews/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 1348-1387)

**Changes**:
1. Check lock flag before overwriting
2. Use functional setState to access previous value
3. Keep existing value if comment is being saved
4. Log when skipping load

**Key Code**:
```typescript
setMidYearGoalComments(prev => {
  const goalComments: Record<string, string> = {};
  Object.entries(checkInData.goals).forEach(([goalId, data]: [string, any]) => {
    // Only update if not currently being saved/edited
    if (isSavingMidYearGoalComment.current[goalId]) {
      console.log(`⏭️ Skipping goal ${goalId} load - currently being saved`);
      goalComments[goalId] = prev[goalId] || ''; // Keep existing value
    } else {
      goalComments[goalId] = data.comments || '';
    }
  });
  return goalComments;
});
```

#### ✅ Added Dedicated Mid-Year Comments useEffect
**File**: `src/app/(ceo)/admin/reviews/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 1428-1488)

**Purpose**: Separate useEffect that ONLY loads mid-year comments when they actually change in the database.

**Key Features**:
1. **Minimal Dependencies**: `[pdr?.ceoFields?.midYearCheckIn, pdrId]`
   - Does NOT depend on `goals` or `behaviors`
   - Only runs when mid-year check-in data actually changes
   - Prevents unnecessary reloads

2. **Respects Save Locks**: Checks `isSavingMidYearGoalComment` before updating

3. **Prevents Unnecessary Updates**: Only updates if value is different from current state

4. **Comprehensive Logging**:
   - `🔄 Mid-year check-in useEffect triggered` - When effect runs
   - `📥 Updated goal ${goalId} comment from database` - When loading new value
   - `⏭️ Skipping goal ${goalId} - currently being saved` - When respecting lock

**Key Code**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('🔄 Mid-year check-in useEffect triggered');
  
  if (!pdr?.ceoFields?.midYearCheckIn || !pdrId) return;

  const checkInData = pdr.ceoFields.midYearCheckIn;
  
  if (checkInData.goals) {
    setMidYearGoalComments(prev => {
      const goalComments: Record<string, string> = { ...prev };
      let hasChanges = false;
      
      Object.entries(checkInData.goals).forEach(([goalId, data]: [string, any]) => {
        const newComment = data.comments || '';
        
        // Only update if not currently being saved AND value is different
        if (!isSavingMidYearGoalComment.current[goalId]) {
          if (prev[goalId] !== newComment) {
            goalComments[goalId] = newComment;
            hasChanges = true;
            console.log(`📥 Updated goal ${goalId} comment from database`);
          }
        } else {
          console.log(`⏭️ Skipping goal ${goalId} - currently being saved`);
        }
      });
      
      return hasChanges ? goalComments : prev; // Only update if changed
    });
  }
  
  // Same for behaviors...
}, [pdr?.ceoFields?.midYearCheckIn, pdrId]);
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: CEO Types Comment and Immediately Switches Tabs

**Before Fix**:
1. CEO types "Great progress on this goal"
2. Debounced save starts (500ms delay)
3. CEO clicks "Final Review" tab before 500ms
4. Final Review refresh triggers goals/behaviors reload
5. Goals reload triggers main useEffect (depends on `goals`)
6. useEffect loads mid-year comments from database (empty)
7. **Comment disappears** ❌

**After Fix**:
1. CEO types "Great progress on this goal"
2. Debounced save starts → sets `isSavingMidYearGoalComment.current[goalId] = true`
3. Console: `🔒 Locking goal ${goalId} comment from being overwritten during save`
4. CEO clicks "Final Review" tab
5. Final Review refresh triggers goals/behaviors reload
6. Main useEffect runs, checks lock flag
7. Console: `⏭️ Skipping goal ${goalId} load - currently being saved`
8. Keeps existing value: "Great progress on this goal"
9. After 500ms, save completes
10. Console: `✅ Goal check-in comment saved successfully`
11. Console: `🔓 Unlocked goal ${goalId} comment after successful save`
12. **Comment persists** ✅

### Scenario 2: Employee Rating Update While CEO Typing

**Before Fix**:
1. CEO typing mid-year comment
2. Employee submits end-year ratings
3. Final Review refresh loads new employee ratings
4. Updates `goals` state with employee ratings
5. Main useEffect runs (depends on `goals`)
6. Reloads mid-year comments from database
7. **Overwrites CEO's unsaved typing** ❌

**After Fix**:
1. CEO typing mid-year comment
2. Debounced save starts → lock set
3. Console: `🔒 Locking goal ${goalId}`
4. Employee submits end-year ratings
5. Final Review refresh loads new employee ratings
6. Main useEffect checks lock flag
7. Console: `⏭️ Skipping goal ${goalId} load - currently being saved`
8. Dedicated mid-year useEffect does NOT run (only depends on `pdr.ceoFields.midYearCheckIn`, not `goals`)
9. Save completes after 500ms
10. Console: `✅ Goal check-in comment saved successfully`
11. **CEO's typing is saved** ✅

### Scenario 3: Page Refresh After Typing

**Before Fix**:
1. CEO types comment
2. Wait for save (500ms)
3. Refresh page
4. Loading useEffect runs
5. Should load saved comment...
6. **Sometimes loaded stale data** ⚠️

**After Fix**:
1. CEO types comment
2. Debounced save starts → lock set
3. Console: `🔒 Locking goal ${goalId}`
4. After 500ms, save completes
5. Console: `✅ Goal check-in comment saved successfully`
6. Console: `🔓 Unlocked goal ${goalId}`
7. Refresh page
8. Dedicated mid-year useEffect runs
9. Console: `📥 Updated goal ${goalId} comment from database`
10. **Loads correct saved value from database** ✅

## Testing Guide

### Test 1: Rapid Tab Switching
1. Navigate to Mid-Year Review tab
2. Type comment in goal check-in field
3. **Immediately** click Final Review tab (within 500ms)
4. **Expected**: Console shows lock message
5. Wait 1 second
6. Return to Mid-Year Review tab
7. **Expected**: Comment is still there
8. **Verify Console**:
   - `🔒 Locking goal...`
   - `⏭️ Skipping goal... - currently being saved`
   - `✅ Goal check-in comment saved successfully`

### Test 2: Multiple Field Edits
1. Type comments in multiple goal check-ins
2. Type comments in multiple behavior check-ins
3. Switch between tabs
4. **Expected**: All comments persist
5. **Verify**: All saves complete independently

### Test 3: Page Refresh
1. Type comment in check-in field
2. Wait 1 second for save to complete
3. Refresh entire page
4. **Expected**: Comment loads from database
5. **Verify Console**: `📥 Updated goal... comment from database`

### Test 4: Save Error Recovery
1. Disconnect network (simulate error)
2. Type comment
3. **Expected**: Lock set but save fails
4. **Expected**: Lock released on error
5. Reconnect network
6. Type again
7. **Expected**: Save succeeds

## Alignment with Previous Fixes

This fix continues the database-first pattern established in previous fixes:

| Feature | Previous Pattern | This Fix |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| **Storage** | Database only | Database only (`pdrs.ceo_fields.midYearCheckIn`) |
| **Save Method** | Debounced auto-save (500ms) | Debounced auto-save (500ms) |
| **Protection** | N/A | **Save locking mechanism (NEW)** |
| **Loading** | On useEffect trigger | On useEffect + separate dedicated effect |
| **Dependencies** | Broad (pdr, goals, behaviors) | **Minimal** (`pdr.ceoFields.midYearCheckIn`, `pdrId`) |
| **Logging** | Basic | **Comprehensive** (lock/unlock/skip/update) |

**Key Innovation**: Save locking mechanism prevents race conditions without complex state management or synchronization logic.

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Console Logs**: Watch for lock/unlock messages during normal usage
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Try rapid typing, multiple tabs, slow network
3. **Verify Other Fields**: Ensure CEO behavior feedback and development feedback still work
4. **Consider Applying Pattern**: This save locking pattern could be applied to other auto-save fields if needed

## Summary

The mid-year check-in comments now save reliably by:
1. **Locking comments during save** to prevent overwrites
2. **Checking locks before loading** to respect in-flight saves
3. **Minimizing reload triggers** with dedicated useEffect
4. **Providing clear feedback** via comprehensive logging

The implementation is robust, debuggable, and follows database-first principles established throughout the application. 🎉
