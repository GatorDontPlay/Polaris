# PDR State Machine Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive state machine to the PDR system with Australian Financial Year support, role-based permissions, and a notification system. **Note: The current codebase operates primarily in demo mode using localStorage for data persistence and simplified status handling.**

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Australian Financial Year Utility (`src/lib/financial-year.ts`)
- **Function**: `computeAustralianFY()` - Calculates FY based on attempt date
- **Logic**: 
  - If month >= July (7): FY = current year to next year (e.g., 2025-2026)
  - If month <= June (6): FY = previous year to current year (e.g., 2024-2025)
- **Features**: Timezone support, validation, formatting utilities
- **Unit Tests**: 25+ test cases covering edge cases and boundary dates

### 2. Updated Data Model
- **New PDR Fields**:
  - `fyLabel` (e.g., "2025-2026")
  - `fyStartDate` / `fyEndDate` (Australian FY boundaries)
  - `employeeFields` / `ceoFields` (JSONB for mirrored data)
  - `meetingBooked` / `meetingBookedAt` (booking functionality)
  - `lockedAt` / `lockedBy` (CEO lock tracking)

- **Status Values** (Current Implementation):
  - `"Created"` - Initial PDR state
  - `"SUBMITTED"` - Employee has submitted for review (primary demo status)
  - `"UNDER_REVIEW"` - CEO is reviewing
  - `"COMPLETED"` - Review process completed
  - Legacy state machine values also defined: `"OPEN_FOR_REVIEW"`, `"PLAN_LOCKED"`, `"PDR_BOOKED"`
  - Additional workflow statuses: `"DRAFT"`, `"MID_YEAR_CHECK"`, `"END_YEAR_REVIEW"`, `"LOCKED"`

- **Notification System**:
  - New `Notification` model with types: `PDR_LOCKED`, `PDR_SUBMITTED`, `PDR_REMINDER`
  - Linked to users and PDRs

### 3. State Machine Logic (`src/lib/pdr-state-machine.ts`)
- **Valid Transitions** (Theoretical Implementation):
  ```
  Created → OPEN_FOR_REVIEW (Employee: submitForReview)
  OPEN_FOR_REVIEW → PLAN_LOCKED (CEO: submitCeoReview)
  PLAN_LOCKED → PDR_BOOKED (CEO: markBooked)
  ```
- **Current Demo Implementation**:
  ```
  Created → SUBMITTED (Employee: submit PDR from review page)
  SUBMITTED → UNDER_REVIEW (CEO: can review and provide feedback)
  UNDER_REVIEW → COMPLETED (Process completion)
  ```

- **Permission System**:
  - Role-based access control
  - Field-level permissions (employee vs CEO fields)
  - State-dependent editability

- **Validation Rules**:
  - Employee submission: requires goals and behaviors
  - CEO submission: requires comments on goals and behaviors
  - Idempotent operations for booking

### 4. API Endpoints

#### New/Updated Endpoints:
- `POST /api/pdrs` - Create PDR with FY calculation
- `PATCH /api/pdrs/[id]` - Draft saves with permissions
- `POST /api/pdrs/[id]/submit-for-review` - Employee submission
- `POST /api/pdrs/[id]/submit-ceo-review` - CEO review submission
- `POST /api/pdrs/[id]/mark-booked` - Meeting booking
- `GET /api/notifications` - Notification management
- `PATCH /api/notifications` - Mark as read/unread

#### Features:
- State transition validation
- Field validation before transitions
- Automatic notification creation
- Idempotent operations
- Proper error handling with specific codes

### 5. Frontend Implementation

#### Current Demo Hooks:
- `useDemoPDR()` - Demo PDR management with localStorage
- `useDemoPDRDashboard()` - Demo dashboard data management
- `useDemoAuth()` - Demo authentication system
- `useDemoAdmin()` - Demo admin/CEO functionality
- `useDemoGoals()` - Goal management in demo mode
- `useDemoBehaviors()` - Behavior management in demo mode

#### Theoretical Hooks (Defined but using demo versions):
- `useNotifications()` - Notification management
- `usePDRPermissions()` - Permission checking
- `useSubmitPDRForReview()` - Employee submission
- `useSubmitCEOReview()` - CEO review submission
- `useMarkPDRAsBooked()` - Meeting booking

#### Updated Components:
- `PDRStatusBadge` - New status display with descriptions
- `NotificationBar` - Real-time notifications
- `PDRManagementDashboard` - CEO dashboard with filters and booking

#### Features:
- **Demo Mode**: localStorage-based data persistence
- **Status-based UI**: Dynamic component rendering based on PDR status
- **Dashboard Updates**: Real-time updates via custom events (`demo-pdr-changed`)
- **Employee Flow**: Create → Submit → View (read-only after submission)
- **CEO Flow**: Review submitted PDRs, provide feedback
- **Simplified Status Mapping**: Focuses on `Created`, `SUBMITTED`, `UNDER_REVIEW`, `COMPLETED`

### 6. CEO Dashboard Updates
- **Demo Implementation**: Uses `useDemoAdmin()` and `useDemoReviews()`
- **Data Source**: Reads from localStorage (`demo_current_pdr`, `demo_pdr_*` keys)
- **Status Filtering**: Supports filtering by PDR status
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates when employee PDRs change
- **Review Interface**: CEO can view and provide feedback on submitted PDRs
- **Status Mapping**: Maps demo statuses to review interface statuses

### 7. Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Financial year calculations, state machine logic
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with role-based permissions
- **Acceptance Tests**: Complete workflow from creation to booking
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary dates, invalid transitions, concurrent edits

   - Full UI functionality for testing and development
   - No database required

2. **Production Framework (Available)**:
