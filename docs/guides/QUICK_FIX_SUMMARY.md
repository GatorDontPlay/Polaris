# Quick Fix Summary - PDR Submission Error

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Race Condition in Submission** (Critical)
- **Problem:** Status changed to `SUBMITTED` first, then tried to update `currentStep` 
- **Result:** 403 Forbidden error "PDR is under CEO review"
- **Fix:** Made status and step update atomic in single transaction

### 2. **Wrong Editable Statuses**
- **Problem:** `MID_YEAR_SUBMITTED` was in employee editable list
- **Result:** Employees could edit during CEO review (incorrect)
- **Fix:** Removed all `*_SUBMITTED` statuses from employee editable list

### 3. **LocalStorage Quota Exceeded**
- **Problem:** React Query cache building up aggressively
- **Result:** `Resource::kQuotaBytes quota exceeded` errors
- **Fix:** Added aggressive cleanup + reduced cache times

## 🚀 To Test

1. **Restart your dev server** (changes to API routes require restart):
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache** (important!):
   - Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Right-click → Clear
   - Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+F5` (Windows)

3. **Test submission flow**:
   - Login as employee
   - Create/complete a PDR (add goals + behaviors)
   - Navigate to Review page
   - Click "Submit PDR"
   - ✅ Should see success message
   - ✅ Should redirect to dashboard
   - ✅ No console errors
   - ✅ PDR shows "Submitted for Review"

4. **Test as CEO**:
   - Login as CEO
   - See submitted PDR in dashboard
   - Open for review
   - Should see all employee data
   - Can add comments and approve
