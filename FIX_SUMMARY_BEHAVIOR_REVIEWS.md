# ✅ CEO Behavior Reviews Fix - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### ❌ Original Problems
1. **Submit button failed** with error: "Could not find the 'updated_at' column"
2. **CEO behavior ratings not saved** - Only saved to localStorage, not database
3. **CEO ratings disappeared** after page refresh or submission
4. **API column mismatch** - Querying `ceo_comments` but column is `ceo_feedback`

### ✅ Solutions Applied

#### 1. Database Migration (Run This First!)
**File:** `fix-end-year-reviews-updated-at.sql`

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run this file to:
# - Add updated_at column to end_year_reviews table
# - Add updated_at column to mid_year_reviews table
# - Create auto-update triggers for both tables
```

#### 2. Backend Fixes (Automatic - Already Done)
- ✅ Complete-final-review API now saves individual behavior/goal reviews
- ✅ PDR API fixed to query correct column names (`ceo_feedback`)
- ✅ Organized behaviors API includes `ceoRating` in response

#### 3. Frontend Fixes (Automatic - Already Done)
- ✅ CEO review page sends all behavior/goal data on submit
- ✅ CEO review page loads saved ratings from database
- ✅ Added detailed logging for debugging

## 🚀 Action Required

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `fix-end-year-reviews-updated-at.sql`
3. Paste and click **RUN**
4. Verify you see success messages

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Start it again
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Fix
1. **Log in as CEO**
2. Navigate to **Admin → Reviews**
3. Select a PDR with status `END_YEAR_SUBMITTED`
4. **Fill in behavior ratings:**
   - Click rating buttons (1-5) for each behavior
   - Enter CEO comments in text areas
5. **Fill in goal ratings (if applicable)**
6. Click **"Complete Final Review"**
7. **Verify success message**
8. **Refresh the page**
9. **Open the same PDR again**
10. ✅ **Verify all ratings and comments are still visible**

## 🔍 How to Verify in Database

```sql
-- Check if updated_at columns were added
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('end_year_reviews', 'mid_year_reviews')
  AND column_name = 'updated_at';

-- Check saved behavior reviews
SELECT 
  b.id,
  cv.name as company_value,
  b.ceo_rating,
  b.ceo_feedback,
  b.updated_at
FROM behaviors b
JOIN company_values cv ON b.value_id = cv.id
WHERE b.pdr_id = 'YOUR_PDR_ID_HERE'
  AND b.ceo_rating IS NOT NULL;
```
