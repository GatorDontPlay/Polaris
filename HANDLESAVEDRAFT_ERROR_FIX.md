# handleSaveDraft ReferenceError - FIXED ✅

## Problem
The employee end-year review page was crashing on load with:
```
page.tsx:514 Uncaught ReferenceError: handleSaveDraft is not defined
```

This occurred after removing localStorage, as the "Save Draft" button was still trying to call a removed function.

## Root Cause
During the localStorage removal process, the `handleSaveDraft` function was removed from the code, but the UI button that referenced it (at line 514) was not removed, causing a ReferenceError that crashed the entire page.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made to `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/end-year/page.tsx`:

1. **Removed `autoSaveStatus` state** (line 60)
   - This state was used to show "Saving..." and "Saved" indicators
   - No longer needed with database-only approach

2. **Removed auto-save status UI and Save Draft button** (lines 494-519)
   - Removed the auto-save spinner and "Saved" checkmark indicators
   - Removed the "Save Draft" button that called the missing function
   
3. **Removed unused imports**
   - Removed `Save` icon (no longer used)
   - Removed `CheckCircle` icon (was only used for "Saved" indicator)

### Why This is the Correct Solution

**Database-Only Approach:**
- All employee data now saves directly to the database on final submit
- Uses batch API endpoints (`/api/pdrs/[id]/save-goal-ratings` and `/api/pdrs/[id]/save-behavior-ratings`)
- Includes pre-submission validation to ensure all ratings are provided
- Includes post-save verification to confirm data was saved correctly

**No Need for Manual Draft Saving:**
- Users don't need to manually save drafts anymore
- The multi-step form holds data in React state while user fills it out
- Final submit saves everything to database in one batch operation
- Aligns with CEO pages which also don't have draft saving

**Consistency Across Application:**
- All pages now follow the same pattern: database-only persistence
- No localStorage usage anywhere in the PDR workflow
- Eliminates QuotaExceededError issues completely

## Verification

✅ **No lint errors** - Code passes all TypeScript checks
✅ **No undefined references** - Verified no remaining references to `handleSaveDraft` or `autoSaveStatus`
✅ **Clean imports** - Removed unused icon imports
✅ **Page should load** - ReferenceError is fixed

## Testing Checklist

When testing, verify:
- [ ] End-year review page loads without console errors
- [ ] Multi-step form allows data entry in all fields
- [ ] "Submit Final Review" button works correctly
- [ ] Employee ratings save to database on submit
- [ ] No localStorage errors appear in console
- [ ] Form validation works (prevents submit without required ratings)
