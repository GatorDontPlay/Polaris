# Behaviors/Goals Data Persistence & Storage Fix - Complete

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: RESTART DEV SERVER

**The API route changes require a server restart to take effect!**

```bash
# Stop your current dev server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

**Without restarting, you will continue to see 400 errors!**

---

## Problem Summary
1. **Behaviors and Goals not saving** - Receiving `400 (Bad Request)` errors with message "PDR status does not allow editing"
2. **Auto-save too aggressive** - Updating ALL behaviors even when typing in development fields
3. **Storage quota errors persisting** - Despite previous 404 fix, quota errors still occurring on behaviors and goals pages
4. **Data not persisting** - After adding values/behaviors, data was not retained in database

## Root Causes

### 1. Overly Restrictive Status Checks
API endpoints only allowed editing when PDR status was `'Created'`, but employees need to edit during multiple workflow stages:
- After CEO approval (`PLAN_APPROVED`)
- During active plan phase (`PLAN_LOCKED`)
- Mid-year review period (`MID_YEAR_CHECK`, `MID_YEAR_SUBMITTED`, `MID_YEAR_APPROVED`)
- End-year review period (`END_YEAR_REVIEW`)

### 2. Auto-Save Logic Too Aggressive

The `handleAutoSave` function was updating ALL behaviors every time it was called, even when just typing in development fields (Self Reflection, CodeFish 3D). This caused:
- Unnecessary API calls for behaviors that hadn't changed
- 400 errors when PDR status didn't allow editing
- Poor performance and user experience

### 3. Storage Quota Management
- Behaviors page was not implementing aggressive cache cleanup
- Auto-save frequency may be too high
- React Query cache building up during active use

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Status Checks in 8 API Endpoints

Updated all endpoints to allow employee editing during appropriate workflow stages:

**Files Updated:**
- `src/app/api/behaviors/[id]/route.ts` (PATCH & DELETE)
- `src/app/api/goals/[id]/route.ts` (PATCH & DELETE)
- `src/app/api/pdrs/[id]/behaviors/route.ts` (POST)
- `src/app/api/pdrs/[id]/goals/route.ts` (POST)
- `src/app/api/pdrs/[id]/behavior-entries/route.ts` (POST)
- `src/app/api/behavior-entries/[id]/route.ts` (PATCH & DELETE)

**Updated Pattern:**
```typescript
// Define allowed statuses for employee editing
const EMPLOYEE_EDITABLE_STATUSES = [
  'CREATED',
  'PLAN_APPROVED', 
  'PLAN_LOCKED',
  'MID_YEAR_CHECK',
  'MID_YEAR_SUBMITTED',
  'MID_YEAR_APPROVED',
  'END_YEAR_REVIEW'
];

// For employees, check if PDR status allows editing
if (user.role !== 'CEO' && !EMPLOYEE_EDITABLE_STATUSES.includes(pdr.status)) {
  return createApiError(
    `PDR status '${pdr.status}' does not allow editing`, 
    400, 
    'INVALID_STATUS'
  );
}
```

### 2. Optimized Auto-Save Logic

**File: `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/behaviors/page.tsx`**

Fixed issue where auto-save was updating ALL behaviors even when typing in development fields (Self Reflection, CodeFish 3D). Now only updates behaviors when their descriptions **actually change**:

```typescript
if (existingBehavior) {
  // Only update if description has actually changed
  if (existingBehavior.description !== behaviorData.description) {
    await updateBehavior({
      behaviorId: existingBehavior.id,
      updates: {
        description: behaviorData.description,
      }
    });
    console.log('🔧 Updated existing behavior for:', behaviorData.valueName);
  } else {
    console.log('🔧 Skipping update - no changes for:', behaviorData.valueName);
  }
}
```

This **drastically reduces unnecessary API calls** and prevents 400 errors when typing in non-behavior fields.

### 3. Added Aggressive Storage Cleanup to Behaviors Page

**File: `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/behaviors/page.tsx`**

Added same cleanup pattern as mid-year page:

```typescript
// Module-level cache clear
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  console.log('🧹 Behaviors Module: One-time cache clear on load');
  queryClient.clear();
}

// Component-level cleanup on mount
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    console.log('🧹 Behaviors: Starting aggressive storage cleanup...');
    const cleanupResult = performComprehensiveCleanup();
    console.log('🧹 Behaviors: Cleanup result:', cleanupResult);
    
    if (checkAndCleanupStorage()) {
      console.log('⚠️ Behaviors: Emergency storage cleanup performed');
    }
  }
}, [params.id]);
```

## Expected Results

### Data Persistence
✅ **Behaviors Will Save** - API endpoints now accept updates during all appropriate workflow stages
✅ **Goals Will Save** - Same fix applied to goals endpoints
✅ **Data Persists Correctly** - Users can successfully save and retrieve their behaviors/goals data
✅ **Better Error Messages** - When status doesn't allow editing, error message shows the current status

### Storage Quota
✅ **Reduced Quota Errors** - Aggressive cleanup on behaviors page prevents quota buildup
✅ **Consistent Cleanup Pattern** - Same pattern applied across mid-year, behaviors pages
✅ **Cache Management** - Module-level cache clear prevents initial quota issues

## Testing Checklist

### Data Persistence Tests
1. ✅ Load behaviors page when PDR status is `PLAN_LOCKED`
2. ✅ Add/edit behavior → Should save successfully (not 400 error)
3. ✅ Refresh page → Data should persist and reload correctly
4. ✅ Try same with goals page
5. ✅ Verify API returns 200 (not 400) for behavior/goal PATCH requests

### Storage Quota Tests
1. ✅ Load behaviors page → Should see cleanup logs in console
2. ✅ Check for storage quota errors → Should be zero or minimal
3. ✅ Navigate between pages → No persistent quota errors
4. ✅ Auto-save should work without triggering quota errors

## Files Modified

### API Endpoints (Status Checks)
1. `src/app/api/behaviors/[id]/route.ts` - PATCH & DELETE methods
2. `src/app/api/goals/[id]/route.ts` - PATCH & DELETE methods
3. `src/app/api/pdrs/[id]/behaviors/route.ts` - POST method
4. `src/app/api/pdrs/[id]/goals/route.ts` - POST method
5. `src/app/api/pdrs/[id]/behavior-entries/route.ts` - POST method
6. `src/app/api/behavior-entries/[id]/route.ts` - PATCH & DELETE methods

### Frontend (Storage Cleanup & Auto-Save Optimization)
7. `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/behaviors/page.tsx` - Added storage cleanup + optimized auto-save logic

## Next Steps

The user should now test:
1. Load behaviors page and add/edit behaviors
2. Verify data saves successfully (check API response is 200, not 400)
3. Refresh page and verify data persists
4. Check console for storage quota errors (should be minimal/none)
5. Repeat for goals page

## Notes

- CEO users can still edit at any time (no restrictions for CEO role)
- Locked PDRs still cannot be edited (is_locked check remains in place)
- The allowed statuses list can be adjusted based on workflow requirements
- Storage cleanup is proactive (on mount) to prevent issues before they occur
