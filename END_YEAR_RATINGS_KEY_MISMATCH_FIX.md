# End-Year Ratings Key Mismatch Fix ✅

## Problem

When submitting the end-year review as an employee, the validation was failing with the error:
```
⚠️ Incomplete Ratings
Please rate all 0 goal(s) and 4 behavior(s) before submitting.
```

Even though the user had completed all behavior ratings, the system couldn't find them.

## Root Cause

There was a **key mismatch** in how behavior assessments were stored versus how they were validated:

### State Storage (WRONG)
The behavior ratings were being stored in state using **company value IDs**:

```typescript
// Line 359 - Using value.id (company value ID)
const behaviorAssessment = behaviorSelfAssessments[value.id] || { rating: 1, reflection: '' };

// Lines 425-428 - Storing with value.id
const updatedAssessments = {
  ...behaviorSelfAssessments,
  [value.id]: {  // ❌ Using company value ID
    ...behaviorSelfAssessments[value.id],
    rating,
  }
};
```

### Validation Check (CORRECT)
But the validation was looking for **behavior IDs**:

```typescript
// Lines 600-603 - Checking with behavior.id
const missingBehaviorRatings = behaviors.filter(behavior => {
  const assessment = behaviorSelfAssessments[behavior.id];  // ✅ Using behavior ID
  return !assessment || assessment.rating === undefined || assessment.rating === 0;
});
```

### The Issue
- **Company Value ID**: e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001`
- **Behavior ID**: e.g., `abc123-behavior-unique-id`

These are completely different IDs! The state was keyed by value ID, but validation was looking for behavior ID keys, so it could never find the ratings.

## Solution

Changed all behavior assessment operations to consistently use `behavior.id` instead of `value.id`.

### Changes Made

**File**: `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/end-year/page.tsx`

#### 1. Added Null Check for Behavior (Line 359)
```typescript
// BEFORE
const behavior = behaviors?.find(b => b.valueId === value.id);
const behaviorAssessment = behaviorSelfAssessments[value.id] || { rating: 1, reflection: '' };

// AFTER
const behavior = behaviors?.find(b => b.valueId === value.id);
if (!behavior) return null;  // ✅ Added null check

const behaviorAssessment = behaviorSelfAssessments[behavior.id] || { rating: 1, reflection: '' };
```

#### 2. Fixed Rating Update (Lines 425-428)
```typescript
// BEFORE
[value.id]: {  // ❌ Wrong key
  ...behaviorSelfAssessments[value.id],
  rating,
}

// AFTER
[behavior.id]: {  // ✅ Correct key
  ...behaviorSelfAssessments[behavior.id],
  rating,
}
```

#### 3. Fixed Reflection Update (Lines 459-461)
```typescript
// BEFORE
[value.id]: {  // ❌ Wrong key
  ...behaviorSelfAssessments[value.id] || { rating: 1 },
  reflection: e.target.value,
}

// AFTER
[behavior.id]: {  // ✅ Correct key
  ...behaviorSelfAssessments[behavior.id] || { rating: 1 },
  reflection: e.target.value,
}
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ User rates behaviors → stored with company value IDs
- ❌ User clicks submit → validation checks behavior IDs
- ❌ Validation finds no ratings (key mismatch)
- ❌ Error: "Please rate all 4 behavior(s)"

### After Fix
- ✅ User rates behaviors → stored with behavior IDs
- ✅ User clicks submit → validation checks behavior IDs
- ✅ Validation finds all ratings (keys match)
- ✅ Submission succeeds

## Data Flow

```
User Interaction
    ↓
State Update (behavior.id as key)
    ↓
behaviorSelfAssessments = {
  "behavior-123": { rating: 4, reflection: "..." },
  "behavior-456": { rating: 5, reflection: "..." },
  ...
}
    ↓
Validation (checks behavior.id keys)
    ↓
✅ All ratings found!
    ↓
Submission succeeds
```

## Why This Happened

The end-year page renders behaviors by iterating through company values and finding the matching behavior:

```typescript
const value = companyValues?.find(v => v.id === step.id);  // Get company value
const behavior = behaviors?.find(b => b.valueId === value.id);  // Find matching behavior
```

The original code mistakenly used `value.id` instead of `behavior.id` when storing ratings, even though the behavior object was available.

## Testing

### Steps to Verify Fix
1. Log in as employee
2. Navigate to an active PDR in end-year review phase
3. Go through each behavior card and:
   - Rate the behavior (1-5 stars)
   - Add reflection text
4. Complete all required fields
5. Click "Submit End Year Review"
6. **Expected**: Submission succeeds without validation errors

### Console Debug
Check browser console for:
```javascript
✅ Validation passed: All ratings present
✅ End-year review submitted successfully to database
✅ Successfully saved 4 behavior ratings
```

## Related Code

The following code sections now all use consistent `behavior.id` keys:

1. **State Initialization** (Lines 89-100): Loads from database with `behavior.id`
2. **UI Display** (Line 361): Retrieves assessment with `behavior.id`
3. **Rating Updates** (Lines 425-428): Stores with `behavior.id`
4. **Reflection Updates** (Lines 459-461): Stores with `behavior.id`
5. **Validation** (Lines 600-603): Checks with `behavior.id`
6. **Submission** (Lines 696-700): Sends with `behavior.id`

## Files Modified

- `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/end-year/page.tsx` - Fixed key mismatch in 3 locations

## Success Criteria

- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Behavior ratings stored with correct keys
- ✅ Validation finds all ratings
- ✅ End-year review submission succeeds
- ✅ Consistent use of behavior.id throughout

## Conclusion

The fix ensures that behavior assessments are consistently keyed by `behavior.id` throughout the entire end-year review flow, from initial state loading through user interactions to final submission validation.

This was a simple but critical bug where the wrong ID was being used as the dictionary key, causing a complete mismatch between stored data and validation logic.
