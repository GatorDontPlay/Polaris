# PDR Submission Error Fix - Complete

## 🎯 Problem Summary

Employee submitted PDR for the first time and encountered multiple critical errors:

1. **500/400 errors on behaviors endpoint** - Behavior creation failing
2. **LocalStorage quota exceeded** - `Resource::kQuotaBytes quota exceeded` 
3. **403 Forbidden on PDR update** - "PDR is under CEO review"
4. **Inconsistent UI state** - PDR shows submitted to CEO but not to employee

## 🔍 Root Causes Identified

### 1. Race Condition in Submission Flow
**The Critical Bug:**
```typescript
// submit-for-review endpoint changed status to SUBMITTED
status: 'SUBMITTED'

// Then review page tried to update currentStep
await updatePDR({ currentStep: 4 }); // ❌ FAILS - SUBMITTED not editable!
```

**Why This Failed:**
- `SUBMITTED` status was NOT in `EMPLOYEE_EDITABLE_STATUSES`
- After submission, PDR was locked for employee editing
- The review page tried to update `currentStep` AFTER the status change
- Result: 403 Forbidden error with message "PDR is under CEO review"

### 2. Incorrect Editable Statuses
```typescript
// OLD - WRONG ❌
export const EMPLOYEE_EDITABLE_STATUSES: PDRStatus[] = [
  PDRStatus.CREATED,
  PDRStatus.PLAN_LOCKED,
  PDRStatus.MID_YEAR_SUBMITTED, // ❌ Employee shouldn't edit during CEO review
  PDRStatus.MID_YEAR_APPROVED,
];
```

**Problem:** `MID_YEAR_SUBMITTED` should NOT be editable by employees because it means the PDR is under CEO review!

### 3. LocalStorage Quota Overwhelmed
- React Query was caching too aggressively
- `gcTime` was 5 minutes (default)
- Auto-save was creating excessive cache entries
- No periodic cleanup was running

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Submission Flow (Atomic Update)
**File:** `src/app/api/pdrs/[id]/submit-for-review/route.ts`

Changed the submission to update `currentStep` atomically with status:

```typescript
// Update PDR status and currentStep atomically
const { data: updatedPdr, error: updateError } = await supabase
  .from('pdrs')
  .update({
    status: 'SUBMITTED',
    current_step: 4, // ✅ Set step 4 atomically with status change
    submitted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  })
  .eq('id', pdrId)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Both `status` and `current_step` change in single database transaction
- No gap between status change and step update
- No race condition where PDR is SUBMITTED but employee tries to edit

### 2. Removed Post-Submission Update
**File:** `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/review/page.tsx`

Removed the problematic post-submission update:

```typescript
// OLD - WRONG ❌
const result = await response.json();
if (isEditable) {
  await updatePDR({ currentStep: 4 }); // ❌ Fails after status change
}

// NEW - CORRECT ✅
const result = await response.json();
// NOTE: Do NOT try to update currentStep after submission!
// The submit-for-review endpoint already changed the status to SUBMITTED,
// which means the PDR is now under CEO review and locked for editing.
```

### 3. Corrected Employee Editable Statuses
**File:** `src/types/pdr-status.ts`

```typescript
// NEW - CORRECT ✅
export const EMPLOYEE_EDITABLE_STATUSES: PDRStatus[] = [
  PDRStatus.CREATED,       // ✅ Employee creating PDR
  PDRStatus.PLAN_LOCKED,   // ✅ After CEO approval, employee continues
  PDRStatus.MID_YEAR_APPROVED, // ✅ After mid-year approval, employee continues
  // Note: SUBMITTED, MID_YEAR_SUBMITTED, and END_YEAR_SUBMITTED are NOT included
  // because those statuses mean the PDR is under CEO review and locked for editing
];
```

**Status Flow:**
1. `CREATED` → Employee edits → Submits → `SUBMITTED` (locked for employee)
2. `SUBMITTED` → CEO reviews → Approves → `PLAN_LOCKED` (unlocked for employee)
3. `PLAN_LOCKED` → Employee adds mid-year → Submits → `MID_YEAR_SUBMITTED` (locked)
4. `MID_YEAR_SUBMITTED` → CEO reviews → Approves → `MID_YEAR_APPROVED` (unlocked)
5. And so on...

### 4. Aggressive LocalStorage Cleanup
**File:** `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/behaviors/page.tsx`

Added comprehensive storage management:

```typescript
// Module-level cleanup on load
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  console.log('🧹 Behaviors Module: Aggressive cache and storage cleanup on load');
  
  // Clear React Query cache completely
  queryClient.clear();
  
  // Clear all React Query localStorage entries
  const reactQueryKeys = Object.keys(localStorage).filter(key => 
    key.startsWith('REACT_QUERY') || 
    key.startsWith('react-query') ||
    key.includes('pdr-') ||
    key.includes('behavior-') ||
    key.includes('goal-')
  );
  reactQueryKeys.forEach(key => {
    try {
      localStorage.removeItem(key);
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn('Failed to remove key:', key);
    }
  });
  
  // Also run comprehensive cleanup utility
  performComprehensiveCleanup();
}

// Periodic cleanup during component lifecycle
useEffect(() => {
  const cleanupInterval = setInterval(() => {
    console.log('🧹 Behaviors: Periodic storage cleanup');
    
    // Clear React Query cache
    queryClient.clear();
    
    // Clear localStorage cache keys if excessive (>30)
    const cacheKeys = Object.keys(localStorage).filter(key => 
      key.startsWith('REACT_QUERY') || 
      key.startsWith('react-query') ||
      key.includes('pdr-') ||
      key.includes('behavior-') ||
      key.includes('goal-')
    );
    
    if (cacheKeys.length > 30) {
      cacheKeys.forEach(key => {
        try {
          localStorage.removeItem(key);
        } catch (e) {
          // Ignore individual errors
        }
      });
      console.log('✅ Periodic cleanup removed', cacheKeys.length, 'cache keys');
    }
  }, 15000); // Every 15 seconds
  
  return () => clearInterval(cleanupInterval);
}, []);
```

### 5. Reduced React Query Cache Times
**File:** `src/lib/query-client.ts`

```typescript
export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 30 * 1000, // Reduced from 60s to 30s
      gcTime: 60 * 1000,    // Reduced from 5min to 1min for aggressive GC
      retry: 1,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      persister: undefined, // Explicitly disable localStorage persistence
    },
    mutations: {
      retry: 1,
      gcTime: 0, // Don't cache mutation results at all
    },
  },
});
```

## 🚀 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Employee Submission Flow:
```
1. Employee clicks "Submit PDR" on review page
   ↓
2. POST /api/pdrs/{id}/submit-for-review
   - Validates goals & behaviors exist
   - Updates status to SUBMITTED
   - Updates current_step to 4 (atomically)
   - Sets submitted_at timestamp
   ↓
3. Success response returns
   ↓
4. Frontend shows success toast
   ↓
5. Redirects to dashboard
   ↓
6. Dashboard shows "Submitted for Review" status
   ↓
7. Employee cannot edit until CEO approves
```

### Status Lifecycle:
```
CREATED (editable by employee)
  → Submit →
SUBMITTED (locked - CEO reviewing)
  → CEO Approves →
PLAN_LOCKED (editable by employee)
  → Submit Mid-Year →
MID_YEAR_SUBMITTED (locked - CEO reviewing)
  → CEO Approves →
MID_YEAR_APPROVED (editable by employee)
  → Submit Final →
END_YEAR_SUBMITTED (locked - CEO reviewing)
  → CEO Completes →
COMPLETED (read-only for all)
```

## 🔧 Files Changed

1. ✅ `src/types/pdr-status.ts` - Fixed EMPLOYEE_EDITABLE_STATUSES
2. ✅ `src/app/api/pdrs/[id]/submit-for-review/route.ts` - Atomic status+step update
3. ✅ `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/review/page.tsx` - Removed post-submission update
4. ✅ `src/app/(employee)/pdr/[id]/behaviors/page.tsx` - Aggressive storage cleanup
5. ✅ `src/lib/query-client.ts` - Reduced cache times

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **DO NOT** try to update PDR after submission - it's locked!
2. **The status change must be atomic** with any other updates
3. **SUBMITTED statuses are NEVER editable** by employees
4. **Only approved statuses** (PLAN_LOCKED, MID_YEAR_APPROVED) allow employee editing
5. **Storage cleanup is aggressive** to prevent quota issues

## 🎉 Expected Results

✅ No more 403 Forbidden errors on submission  
✅ No more "PDR is under CEO review" errors for employees  
✅ No more LocalStorage quota exceeded errors  
✅ Clean submission flow from employee perspective  
✅ Correct status shown to CEO  
✅ Proper locking prevents editing during review  
✅ Periodic cleanup keeps storage usage low  

## 🔄 If Issues Persist

1. **Clear browser cache** completely
2. **Hard refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+F5)
3. **Restart dev server** to apply API changes
4. **Check console** for cleanup messages
5. **Monitor localStorage** size in DevTools → Application → Local Storage
6. **Verify database** status matches UI status
