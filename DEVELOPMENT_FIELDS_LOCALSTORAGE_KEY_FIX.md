# Development Fields localStorage Key Mismatch - FIXED

## Problem
Self Reflection and CodeFish 3D development fields were not saving/persisting data. Users would type text, but after refreshing the page, the data would be gone.

## Root Cause
**localStorage key mismatch** between save and load operations:

- **Page saves to:** `development_draft_${params.id}` ✅
- **Form loads from:** `demo_development_${pdrId}` ❌

Result: Data was being saved to one key but loaded from a different key, making it appear as if data was not being saved at all.

## Fix Applied

Updated `src/components/forms/structured-behavior-form.tsx` to use the correct localStorage key:

**Before:**
```typescript
const data = localStorage.getItem(`demo_development_${pdrId}`);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const data = localStorage.getItem(`development_draft_${pdrId}`);
```

## Testing

Now both operations use the same key: `development_draft_${pdrId}`

**To test:**
1. ✅ Type text in "Self Reflection" field
2. ✅ Type text in "CodeFish 3D - Deep Dive Development" field
3. ✅ Wait a moment (auto-save runs with debounce)
4. ✅ Check console: Should see "✅ Development data auto-saved as draft"
5. ✅ Refresh the page
6. ✅ Both fields should retain their values

## Files Modified
- `src/components/forms/structured-behavior-form.tsx` - Fixed localStorage key from `demo_development_` to `development_draft_`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Self Reflection field persists** - Data saves to localStorage and loads on page refresh  
✅ **CodeFish 3D field persists** - Same persistence behavior  
✅ **Auto-save works correctly** - Console logs confirm saves  
✅ **No page refresh needed** - Changes take effect immediately  

The development fields should now save and persist correctly! 🎉
